        <p>In learning phases you will see two options like below. The options offer point amounts with some probability.
        You know the amount of points (e.g., 5 points and 7 points). But you <b>will not see the probabilities.</b>
        Each amount of points occurs with some probability (e.g., 5 points 80% of the time).</p>
        <p><b>Your task is to learn about the hidden probabilities.</b> To learn about the probabilities you can click on an option.
        Clicking causes the option to play out a point draw according to the hidden probabilities and show the drawn amount of points
        (e.g., 5 points will appear in 80 of 100 clicks if the hidden probability is 80%).</p>
        <p>You will have a maximum of {{ num_samples }} clicks per block to learn about the hidden probabilities (=50 clicks per learning phase). However, you can move on at any time.
        Once you feel like you understand the probabilities of the options you can continue to phase 2 by clicking on the
        “I am ready to move on” button.</p>
