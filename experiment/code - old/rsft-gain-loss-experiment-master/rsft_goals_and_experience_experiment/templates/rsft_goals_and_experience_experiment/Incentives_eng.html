  After completion of the study and correctly solving the easy attention check choices, you will receive {{ participation_fee }}. In addition to this you can receive a bonus payment. The exact height of your bonus depends on your choices during choice phases.

  At the end of the study, four decision rounds will be drawn randomly out of all the subsequent rounds. These bonus rounds matter for your bonus. For each of the four bonus rounds, you will receive additional {{bonus}}, if you reach the threshold in this round. This means your bonus can be between £0 to £1.00.
