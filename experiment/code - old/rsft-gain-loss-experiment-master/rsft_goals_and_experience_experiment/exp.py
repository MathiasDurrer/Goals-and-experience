   * A phase consists of a block of one (or more) blocks of stimuli.

   * Stimuli must be in a .csv file which has one row per stimulus
   * Stimuli .csv files should be in the folder 'static/stimuli/'
   
   For example if the stimuli are stored as 'static/stimuli/choice_stimuli.csv' then you must use phases = ["choice_stimuli"]
