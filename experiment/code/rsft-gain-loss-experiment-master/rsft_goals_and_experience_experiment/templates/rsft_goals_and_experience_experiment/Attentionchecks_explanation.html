    <h3>Attention checks</h3>
    <p>In this experiment there are attention checks. This means there are trials in the experiment that are designed to have a very obvious correct answer.
    If you answer more than 50% of those trials incorrectly, we have to assume you did not pay attention and therefore can only pay 50% of your earnings.
    Please indicate that you have understood this below. By selecting "I have understood this" you acknowledge that this might impact your payment.</p>
