        <p>In phase 1 you will see two options like below. The options offer point amounts with some probability.
        You know the amount of points (e.g., 5 points and 7 points). But you <b>will not know the probabilities.</b>
        Each amount of points occurs with some probability (e.g., 5 points 80% of the time).</p>
        <p><b>Your task is to learn about the hidden probabilities.</b> To learn about the probabilities you can click on an option.
        Clicking causes the option to play out a point draw according to the probabilities and show the drawn amount of points
        (e.g., in 80 of 100 clicks 5 points will be shown).
        You will have a maximum of {{ num_samples }} clicks to do so, however you can move on at any time.
        Once you feel like you understand the probabilities of the options you can continue to phase 2 by clicking on the
        “I am ready to move on” button.</p>
        <p>Above the options there will be a header that reads “Your threshold will be XX”.
        This informs you about the threshold you will have to reach or exceed in phase 2 (The threshold will be explained further on the next page).</p>
